# Job-Fire Monorepo

**Job-Fire** is a monorepo that offers a flexible job scheduling system with support for different database adapters. The core library provides general scheduling functionalities, while specific adapters for databases like Redis and MongoDB are available as separate packages, allowing users to choose only the database dependencies they need.

## √úbersicht

-   **Core Package** (`job-fire`): Provides the foundational scheduling functions of the Job-Fire system.
-   **Redis Adapter** (`job-fire.redis`): Adds Redis support for `job-fire`.
-   **MongoDB Adapter** (`job-fire.mongo`): Adds MongoDB support for `job-fire`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install the core package along with only the adapters you need.

```bash
# Install core package
npm install job-fire

# Optional: install Redis adapter
npm install job-fire.redis

# Optional: install MongoDB adapter
npm install job-fire.mongo
```

## üöÄ Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use the core package together with the Redis adapter:

```typescript
import { Scheduler } from "job-fire";
import { RedisAdapter } from "job-fire.redis";

const scheduler = new Scheduler(new RedisAdapter());
scheduler.addJob(
    "myJob",
    () => {
        console.log("Job is running!");
    },
    { interval: 1000 }
);
```
